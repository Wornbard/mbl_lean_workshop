# Things we will attempt to cover

## Day 1

1. Introduction to proof assistants, and Lean in particular, some examples of things it can and can not do. What people hope it will be able to achieve in the near and more distant future.

2. Structure of problems and proofs. Basic tactics with explanations.

3. Doing a billion and one example proofs in logic. By the end everyone should be able to prove results such as 
```
⊢ (P ∨ Q) ↔ (¬P → Q)
```

## Day 2

1. Time to do serious mathematics. My plan is to show that there exists a bijection between equivalence relations and partitions on any set. **If there is a result that someone would really like to show, we can discuss it after the 1<sup>st</sup> day. We will think if it's feasible and maybe try doing that instead/afterwards.**

2. If there is time left, we will talk about type theory (which Lean is based on) and how it differs from set theory. Understanding this should clarify a lot of notation used in the language.

## Day 3

1. Very basic group theory. I do not assume any previous knowledge. We won't get too far past basic definitions. The main goal is to show you how hard it is to explain 'simple mathematics' to a computer.

2. Summary, self-learning resources etc.
